# Help-desk-prototype-system
This is a read me file for the HelpDesk ticketing prtotype Python script. In this script we have 
created five sections to complete all the requirement. First one is taking all input from the program which includes all info with respect
to the ticket. Second one is ticket Generation with the global variable starting with 2000 as per the requirement.
Thrid one is Feedback Response to collect feedback and if not provided the default is taken that is 'not provided'. Fouth one is Ticket
 status including open/close/reopen. Fifth one is Password changed module which can be extracted from the ticket desciption
 and then automatically with the two condition mention in the requirement and the last one is displaying output with the specific format.
